### Estimator comes with a method that handles distributed training and evaluation

- Distribute the graph
- Share variables
- Evaluate occassionally
- Handle machine failures
- Create checkpoint files
- Recover from failures
- Save summaries for Tensorboard

estimator = tf.estimator.LinearRegressor(
                         model_dir=output_dir,
                         feature_columns=feature_cols)
                         
...

tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator,
                               train_spec,
                               eval_spec)
                               
...

//Pass in:
1. Estimator
2. Train Spec
3. Eval Spec

### TIP!
In TensorFlow, data is often divided into training and evaluation sets, which defines a path for measuring effectiveness and for improvement.
